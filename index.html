    <h1>Hello there, my name is Agnes!</h1>
    <img id="img-profile-circle" src="images/aggy_profile.jpg">
    <p>I'm a tech and data enthusiast. I'm more logical and analytical, and a bit less on the artistic side, but that's just me speaking from my comfort zone!</p>
    <p>I have a few years of experience as a data analyst/engineer, and now I am branching out to the world of web development and software engineering.</p>
    <p>To see my full experience, please see my LinkedIn profile.</p>

    <h2>I'm a programmer!</h2>
    <p>I'm on the current Le Wagon batch #236 in Shanghai with 1 goal in mind: I would like to be able to do everything myself without relying on the IT department...</p>

    <h2>Professional Interests</h2>
    <p>Products or services that offer <strong>small businesses</strong> and/or <strong>startups</strong> solutions to their daily problem. This can be in form of smaller scales of various <strong>SaaS</strong> that can help them automate and improve their processes, or in form of technical <strong>consultancies</strong>.</p>

  <div class="container-white container-detail">
    <h2>The Obssession on Data</h2>
    <p>As much as I am loving the product creation and development that Le Wagon is teaching me, I know that I still would like to come back to the world of Data. Data holds the key to many things in life, and if leveraged the correct way, it holds the key to making profitable business as well.</p>
    <p>I've seen firsthands, how data can make or break a business. Having consistent, good structured, and accessible data should be a business' common practice. It is however not yet the norm, especially with smaller companies, who don't own the in-house expertise on how to manage data.</p>
    <p>One of my professional goal in life, is to, one day, be able to help these businesses tackle this problem without breaking bank.</p>

  <div class="container-white container-detail">
    <h2>Personal Interests</h2>
    <p>Personally, I'm a very physically active person. My morning routine 4 to 5 times a week, is to go to a (super sweaty) <strong>sweat session</strong> at <a href="https://f45training.cn/jingan/" target=_blank id="gym-link"><strong>F45</strong></a>. On the weekend, to "relax" I play (mildly competitive) indoor <strong>volleyball</strong>, and/or a game of <strong>Archery Tag</strong> (a combination of dodgeball and paintball).</p>
