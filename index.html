    <h1>Hello there, my name is Agnes!</h1>
    <img id="img-profile-circle" src="images/aggy_profile.jpg">
    <p>I'm a tech and data enthusiast. I'm more logical and analytical, and a bit less on the artistic side, but that's just me speaking from my comfort zone!</p>
    <p>I have a few years of experience as a data analyst/engineer, and now I am branching out to the world of web development and software engineering.</p>
    <p>To see my full experience, please see my LinkedIn profile.</p>

    <h2>I'm a programmer!</h2>
    <p>I'm on the current Le Wagon batch #236 in Shanghai with 1 goal in mind: I would like to be able to do everything myself without relying on the IT department...</p>

    <h2>Professional Interests</h2>
    <p>Products or services that offer <strong>small businesses</strong> and/or <strong>startups</strong> solutions to their daily problem. This can be in form of smaller scales of various <strong>SaaS</strong> that can help them automate and improve their processes, or in form of technical <strong>consultancies</strong>.</p>

  <div class="container-white container-detail">
    <h2>The Obssession about Data</h2>
    <p>As much as I am loving the product creation and development that Le Wagon is teaching me, I still would like to go back to the world of Data. If leveraged the correct way, it holds the key to making profitable business, among many other things.</p>
    <p>I've seen firsthands, how data can make or break a business. Having consistent, good structured, and accessible data should be a business' common practice. It is however not yet the norm, especially with smaller companies, who don't own the in-house expertise on how to manage data.</p>
    <p>One of my professional goals in life, is to, one day, be able to help these businesses tackle this problem without them having to break the bank.</p>

  <div class="container-white container-detail">
    <h2>Personal Interests</h2>
    <p>Personally, I'm a very physically active person. My morning routine 4 to 5 times a week, is to go to a (super sweaty) <strong>sweat session</strong> at <a href="https://f45training.cn/jingan/" target=_blank id="gym-link"><strong>F45</strong></a>. On the weekend, to "relax" I play (mildly competitive) indoor <strong>volleyball</strong>, and/or a game of <strong>Archery Tag</strong> (a combination of dodgeball and paintball).</p>
